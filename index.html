				<h2> Hi!</h2>
				<p>  I am Lex. I was born here, on planet earth, but I've never really felt like it was my "home" .. I spend alot of time looking to the stars, to find it...</p>
				<p> I also spend a lot of time, trying to make this place my home.. Or at least, find my place here. </p>
				<br>
				<p> I currently go to college- I work, I eat and sleep and have cats and someone special, who loves me </p> 
			
				<p> But my passion in life, is contemplation of the unknown, I am a ponderer and an artist- So here, I will show you "my real life, ie- my resume, my email address, my socials, probably pics of my cats... What I currently study as well as ...</p>
